# Testing

## manual testing
- tedious and cumbersome, testing features one by one
if you don't test everything, you will miss something
- good to test out some things tho

## automated testing
- write some code that tests the code!
- executed during dev, and runs prefined and tests most things automatically
- initial setup, but less work than manual
- predictable & consistent
- high / complete code & scenario coverage can be achieved
